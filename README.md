# Library Management System

A comprehensive web-based application for managing library operations, including book inventory, user management, and borrowing processes. This project focuses on robust database design and efficient data handling.

## Project Overview

This Library Management System is built with Django and PostgreSQL, designed to streamline the operations of a modern library. It provides distinct interfaces for administrators (librarians) and standard users, ensuring secure and efficient access to library resources.

## Database Design

The core of this project is its relational database schema, designed to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.

### ER Diagram Description

The database consists of the following key entities and relationships:

*   **Users**: Stores user information including authentication credentials and roles (admin/user).
*   **Books**: Manages the inventory of books, including details like title, author, quantity, and thumbnail.
*   **Categories**: Defines the various genres or categories of books.
*   **BooksBorrowed**: A junction table recording borrowing transactions. It links `Users` and `Books`, tracking who borrowed what, when, and the due date.
*   **CategoriesPerBook**: A junction table implementing a Many-to-Many relationship between `Books` and `Categories`, allowing a book to belong to multiple categories.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
*   Docker & Docker Compose
*   Make (optional, for easy commands)

### Running the Project

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd library-management-system
    ```

2.  **Start the application**
    Use the `make` command to build and start the containers, run migrations, and load initial data.
